                                <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>odern journalism utilises digital technology to tell compelling stories and reinterpret storytelling into more visually appealing formats. An example of this digital technology is Web 2.0, which began in 2004<a href="#note-1" class="reference-link">1</a>. Unlike the web 1.0-era, which limited the audience to viewing content passively, web 2.0 enables readers to engage with each other through social media dialogue or as creators of user-generated content in a virtual community<a href="#note-2" class="reference-link">2</a>. Web 2.0 is characterised by greater user interactivity, enhanced communication channels, participatory culture, and ease of use<a href="#note-3" class="reference-link">3</a>. In a 13-year-long research (2007-2020), Consumer data outfit, Statista found that 70% of the British population accessed their news via the web<a href="#note-4" class="reference-link">4</a>. This trend was also corroborated by the United Kingdom's Office of communications, which conducted a poll for the number of British residents who access the news via online portals and identified that 66% of the total population prefer to source their daily news from the internet and social media rather than traditional news platforms.</p>

                                <p>The shift in storytelling techniques has coincided with the audience's desire for more visually appealing content, with the internet empowering contemporary journalism to distribute content in two or more formats across multiple media platforms. For instance, in 2003, the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing went to the Los Angeles Times' <em>Enrique's Journey</em>, a story made up of only one picture per chapter and a total of six chapters<a href="#note-24" class="reference-link">24</a>. Fast forward a decade later, with the invention of Web 2.0, much has changed. In 2013, the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing went to the New York Times story <em>"Snow Fall"</em>, which was an online story that hovered around one topic from multiple angles, comprising six web chapters with video, audio, interactive graphics, looping videos, and many other digital technological tools<a href="#note-25" class="reference-link">25</a>. Furthermore, the 2022 winner (the Atlantic's <em>'20 Years Gone'</em>) included an audio version of the article published as a podcast on its website, Audm for Apple or Android, and a PDF copy sold on Amazon.com, giving readers the option to read, listen to, or do both at the same time<a href="#note-26" class="reference-link">26</a>. The contrasting elements of these three award-winning stories across twenty years exemplify how digital technology has impacted storytelling in contemporary journalism. While these impacts remain widely spread, this essay will focus on the current internet technology (Web 2.0) and its impact on storytelling.</p>

                                <h2>Impact On Writing Style And Content</h2>
                                <p>Web 2.0 technology has encouraged the inclusion of immersive, responsive content that has enhanced the standard narrative structure in journalism<a href="#note-5" class="reference-link">5</a>. Benson et al. claim that while the main narrative of a news report remains the most common aspect of journalism writing, Web 2.0 has ensured that other additional elements, such as charts, images, and videos, are becoming more prevalent, particularly in long-form storytelling<a href="#note-6" class="reference-link">6</a>. Long-form storytelling existed in early British journalism, combining journalistic and literary elements in the 18th and 19th centuries<a href="#note-7" class="reference-link">7</a>. In the early 20th century, as journalism became more professionalised, there was a demand for objectivity and a desire to avoid any novelistic elements<a href="#note-8" class="reference-link">8</a>. The creative non-fiction or narrative method of writing news was replaced with a more objective, neutral and linear style that followed a non-chronological order called the inverted pyramid<a href="#note-9" class="reference-link">9</a>. This writing style has come under scrutiny with growing changes in consumer behaviour and audience preferences for online content<a href="#note-10" class="reference-link">10</a>. While the inverted pyramid style is still dominant in writing hard-news stories in real-time, Web 2.0 allows for a wealth of new ways of storytelling that create opportunities for more interactive engagement with the news<a href="#note-11" class="reference-link">11</a>.</p>

                                <p>The New York Times story "Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek" can be considered as a piece of long-form digital storytelling that evaded the inverted pyramid structure and was more chronological, applying the 'delayed drop' or delayed lead feature<a href="#note-12" class="reference-link">12</a>. The text served as an invitation to readers, helping the audience to form a mental image of the scenes. At the same time, the visual descriptions like the video, interactive graphics, and maps filled up for a mental image of the scenes of the incident<a href="#note-13" class="reference-link">13</a>. Both features significantly contributed to the reader's immersion in different ways: textual descriptions for imaginative processes and visual descriptions for an experiential feeling of the scenes<a href="#note-14" class="reference-link">14</a>. "Snow Fall" connoted a remarkable contribution to storytelling in contemporary journalism due to its comprehensive and immersive features<a href="#note-15" class="reference-link">15</a>.</p>

                                <img src="/images/j3.webp" alt="Modern Journalism Storytelling" class="content-image">
                                
                                <p class="image-caption">Evolution of storytelling formats in modern journalism</p>

                                <p>Additionally, Web 2.0 technologies have immensely democratized storytelling in contemporary journalism, ensuring that information flows in a non-linear style between readers and journalists. The audience can actively create content for others to see, enabling a many-to-many communication model<a href="#note-16" class="reference-link">16</a>. 21st-century media organisations like Daily Wire and traditional media organisations such as Daily Mail and the BBC have adopted interactive features such as comment sections, live chat, user-generated reports, interactive games, quizzes, videos, and infographics across its online platforms<a href="#note-17" class="reference-link">17</a>. For example, the BBC had a live feed for every game at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, posting minute-by-minute updates on its website, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube channels<a href="#note-18" class="reference-link">18</a>. The BBC's story on the World Cup semi-final game between Croatia and Argentina had a podcast, a video showing the highlights of the game, several infographics showing the match statistics and player ratings, and a comment section with over 2,000 comments from the audience less than six hours after the game<a href="#note-19" class="reference-link">19</a>. This comment section under the news report enables direct communication between readers and journalists, allowing readers to state their opinions on published stories<a href="#note-20" class="reference-link">20</a>. It also allows the newsroom to receive feedback from its audience, which aids in determining what works best and where improvements can be made<a href="#note-21" class="reference-link">21</a>.</p>
                                
                                <p>Television and Radio storytelling have also adopted interactivity provided by web 2.0 technologies. BBC’s TV presenters read tweets and Instagram posts from the audience after reading out the stories of the day. BBC’s Radio 4 has a program that reads out comments on stories that have already been posted on its social media handles like Twitter and Instagram and discusses readers' comments. Instagram, Youtube and TikTok thrive on high-quality videos with a global audience that enables media organisations to go beyond geographical borders<a href="#note-5" class="reference-link">5</a>. Hence, established publishers are launching video channels to reach new audiences. News provider VG.no reaches 56% of Norway's population through its online video channel VGTV, with its original newspaper reaching only 9%<a href="#note-18" class="reference-link">2</a> Their long-form video is now being published or broadcast simultaneously in several newspapers and television stations globally<a href="#note-18" class="reference-link">13</a>Including these video elements in storytelling can significantly increase the time spent by readers on stories. Fishman <a href="#note-21" class="reference-link">21</a> discovered that people spent 1.4x longer on pages with videos than on pages without video content. This increase was nearly two minutes per page. Furthermore, live chat widgets offer a highly interactive experience. They typically include features that enable readers to connect to a journalist for real-time live chat or communicate with a chatbot (automated journalist), View blog posts or articles that are relevant to the page they are viewing, as well as search knowledge base articles<a href="#note-16" class="reference-link">16</a>
                                    This can be used in a various ways. Journalists can use it to connect with audience support while reading to find answers that may have prevented them from clicking or reading a specific article. For example, they can learn which headlines are effective and what problems readers may be experiencing with a page or story<a href="#note-11" class="reference-link">11</a>.
                                    Although the inclusion of a variety of multimedia features offers several opportunities, it can be argued that good-quality journalism is still essential <a href="#note-9" class="reference-link">9</a>. News stories like the BBC story on the world cup game that included multimedia elements in its reports still adopted the ethical characteristics of traditional storytelling, such as accuracy, factuality and objectivity. Also, journalists investigate stories, gather content like interviews and form a story from the event. Several journalists are also building new skills required to produce a comprehensive multimedia story <a href="#note-6" class="reference-link">6</a>. The requirements for producing a story with several multimedia features have encouraged interdisciplinary collaborations between journalism and other fields <a href="#note-5" class="reference-link">5</a>
                                
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Artificial intelligence experts, computer scientists, data analysts and web developers are now part of the storytelling caste in modern newsrooms <a href="#note-12" class="reference-link">12</a>. A 2016 report by the Tow-Knight centre for entrepreneurial journalism revealed that newsrooms are more interested in recruiting journalists who are entrepreneurial savvy and combine advanced skills such as computational analysis, visual production, coding, and multi-platform knowledge that extend beyond the traditional basics of writing and research. News organisations like Vox and BuzzFeed, who were formerly seen as start-up rivals to traditional organisations, are diversifying their newsrooms by adding more digital and data-centric roles. For example, Vox established a team dedicated to producing content for the social media messaging service Snapchat. In another instance, BuzzFeed maintains distinct departments for data analytics and visualisations, with data storytelling fast becoming a veritable addition to news <a href="#note-15" class="reference-link">15</a>. Several news organisations like ProPublica and Stats Perform have built their business models specifically on data and artificial intelligence. Stats Perform a UK media organisation that covers 83,000 events per year and 300 leagues and competitions using live data, historical databases, and artificial intelligence-enabled reporting <a href="#note-6" class="reference-link">6</a>. 
                                    Cooper <a href="#note-20" class="reference-link">20</a> examined how Stats Perform created 'The Analyst', an AI model that provided detailed Euro 2020 predictions with goal alerts and half-time reports in every game. This predictive content built by artificial intelligence engineers who are part of the company's newsroom usually shares stories that provide digitally enabled fans with an interactive experience by monitoring the competition, top performers, and the impact of on-field events on a team's chances. It produced daily editorial content for fans, delivering pre-match video previews with analysis outlining which nations were most likely to win based on predictive data. The videos on this platform also included fan prediction from Live Twitter polls which were used to further strengthen interaction. The editorial team combined with the AI Engineers to produce an automated daily blog, published at both half-time and full-time, and provided a data powered breakdown of every match. The analyst generated 250,000 views, with nearly half focusing on the data-inspired predictions, while the website traffic increased by over 40% within two months <a href="#note-20" class="reference-link">20</a>. The analyst generates millions of impressions across social media platforms and has been picked by several publishers worldwide, including Skysports, AS, Bein sports and the BBC <a href="#note-13" class="reference-link">13</a>. While content automation tools and data-inspired reports have been crucial to phenomenal storytelling in modern journalism, web metrics showing public perception of stories have also shaped storytelling within and outside the newsroom<a href="#note-23" class="reference-link">23</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Within the newsroom, digital content and the shift toward reader registration and subscription have resulted in an avalanche of behavioural data. Metrics of clicks, views and shares can easily be retrieved for every web-based story <a href="#note-2" class="reference-link">2</a>. Newsrooms systematically mine web metrics for insights and use them to adapt their content and storytelling techniques actively <a href="#note-2" class="reference-link">22</a>. This more profound approach to news reports is forging a new focus and collaboration within and outside the industry <a href="#note-17" class="reference-link">17</a>. The Washington Post is benefiting from Amazon's tech expertise. Both organisations partnered to build the 'Arc Publishing software using amazon's AWS cloud service, an analytics tool that offers alternative headline suggestions and predicts which stories will go viral. In this respect, their artificial Intelligence model leverages data to produce better results than a human editor. 
                                    This technology now plans to focus on real-time lead metrics to enable journalists to take action during the life of a story and enhance its reach <a href="#note-20" class="reference-link">20</a>. Such advancements have aided journalists in understanding the best stories and styles for their audiences based on preferences and search engine optimisation. Nelson and Tandoc <a href="#note-26" class="reference-link">26</a>, while examining several media organisations between 2013 – 2016, found out that the phrase "doing well" was used for a story with the highest number of clicks and became a regular line around 2013. This click-based measure of success also manifested in the news organisation's daily budget meetings, where publishers ranking software, 'Chartbeat', was employed to list the news stories with the highest clicks. These ranking determined were a story would be placed on the website or other platforms such as twitter and facebook. Further findings revealed the use of another phrase "doing good" around 2016, which differentiated between a story that had more clicks versus a story that served as a public watchdog, won an award or impacted public policy <a href="#note-12" class="reference-link">12</a>. 
                                    It is, therefore, possible to suggest that there remains a divide between a good story ('doing good') and a story that is sensational enough to attract lots of clicks ('doing well') <a href="#note-17" class="reference-link">17</a>. This research also showed that a story could get more clicks by simple adjustments of the headline. For example, a newsroom story was ranked 40 on Chartbeat and moved up to five simply because of a change in the headline <a href="#note-23" class="reference-link">23</a>. While sensationalism existed in traditional tabloid journalism, It is evident that there is an obsession to tailor headlines even to sound different from the content of the story to secure more clicks and improve web analytics <a href="#note-16" class="reference-link">16</a>. So far, most scholars and practitioners have adjudged the growing importance of web analytics in storytelling to be a negative development for journalism <a href="#note-23" class="reference-link">23</a>. Media experts criticise the fast pace of posting real-time information on news websites, painting journalists as blindly racing on a "hamster wheel" of constant updates, tweets, and blog postings. They criticise "clickbait" as undermining the production of quality information, and frequently hold the short news cycle responsible for the loss or diminished prominence of 'shoe-leather' reporting and investigative journalism <a href="#note-22" class="reference-link">22</a>. For example, after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, these criticisms grew: people accused news outlets and cable television of giving Trump a free platform in the interest of increasing page views by covering his provocations <a href="#note-23" class="reference-link">23</a>. 
                                    These critics also argue that online news organisations' reliance on algorithmically driven social media platforms and traffic-focused business models is responsible for several issues in the public domain <a href="#note-25" class="reference-link">25</a>.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                                <p>In summary, the impacts of digital technology on storytelling in contemporary journalism can be noticed when an online story on The Mail Online is juxtaposed with the same story in its traditional newspaper, DailyMail<a href="#note-15" class="reference-link">15</a>. Although the advantages and opportunities inherent in web 2.o have been evaluated with various theories and examples, the disadvantages and challenges have also been discussed.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, It can be argued that audience metrics have adversely impacted the quality of stories, with newsrooms creating overtly sensational headlines to attract clicks and views; nevertheless, it has provided the opportunity for journalists to understand audience preference<a href="#note-16" class="reference-link">16</a>. Furthermore, 'Click-baits' have always existed in journalism in the form of sensational headlines in tabloid newspapers like The Sun and Daily Mirror, thus showing that journalism is adapting rather than diminishing.  Overall, it is evident that 21st-century journalism is leveraging digital technology to create more engaging stories while adapting to changing audience behaviour and the challenges of metrics-inspired journalism<a href="#note-23" class="reference-link">23</a>.</p>
