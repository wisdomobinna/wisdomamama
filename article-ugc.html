From citizen journalism to social media commentary, User-generated content(UGC) has opened up new opportunities for journalists to cover stories and engage with audiences<a href="#ref1" class="reference-link">[1]</a>. A 2021 study by the Reuters Institute of Journalism showed that 52% of news organisations surveyed use UGC in their news coverage. The same study found that 73% of the news organisations surveyed use social media-generated content as a source or resource in publications<a href="#ref2" class="reference-link">[2]</a>. However, the rise of UGC has also raised significant practice, policy, and legal issues that have challenged journalistic legitimacy<a href="#ref3" class="reference-link">[3]</a>.

                                Legal issues in the context of user-generated content refer to matters or problems related to the law, including privacy rights and content censorship<a href="#ref4" class="reference-link">[4]</a>. These issues have heightened concerns about journalistic boundaries and the confines of the law, challenging the traditional role of journalists as gatekeepers of the news and potentially requiring legal intervention or resolution<a href="#ref5" class="reference-link">[5]</a>.

                                In 2010, French media outlets AFP and Getty Images paid $ 1.2 million in damages to photographer Daniel Morel who sued the duo for obtaining his images from Twitter and distributing it without his consent<a href="#ref6" class="reference-link">[6]</a>. Also, in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing in the USA, several news outlets used user-generated content to identify suspects in the case. However, some of the suspects identified by the media were innocent bystanders who had been falsely accused<a href="#ref7" class="reference-link">[7]</a>. Similarly, in 2021 the Nigerian government banned Twitter for seven months, sued the BBC and fined over 15 other media organisations operating in the country for transmitting user-generated content uploaded by terrorists without verification<a href="#ref8" class="reference-link">[8]</a>.

                                These three examples across two decades and three continents underscore the issues raised by the use of UGC in journalism. While these issues are widely spread, this essay will focus on the practice, policy, and legal issues raised by the rise of User-generated-content (UGC) and the implications on the journalism industry through the analyses of relevant theories and examples.

                            <h2>User-generated Content: Legal Issues and Implications for Journalism</h2>

                            <p>
                                Collaboration between journalists and the audience has led to copyright infringements and several legal, policy and practice issues. Copyright infringement in the context of User-generated-content (UGC) refers to the unauthorised use of copyrighted material by journalists or news media organisations without obtaining proper permission or giving proper attribution to the original content creator<a href="#ref9" class="reference-link">[9]</a>. This can occur when UGC containing copyrighted material, such as photographs, videos, or written content, is used in news production without obtaining licenses or permissions from the content owner<a href="#ref10" class="reference-link">[10]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Interestingly, the concerns regarding copyright issues in journalism have significantly increased in the past two decades. A 2020 report by the United States Copyright Office titled "Section 512 Study: Views on the Efficacy of Notice-and-Takedown Procedures Relating to User-Generated Content" discovered that while the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act's notice-and-takedown mechanism has helped to reduce copyright infringement online, there are still significant examples of infringement and takedown requests directed towards news media organisations<a href="#ref11" class="reference-link">[11]</a>. According to the research, news organisations frequently incorporate UGC in their reporting, resulting in copyright infringements, usually occurring when sufficient licences are not obtained<a href="#ref12" class="reference-link">[12]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This issue has led to several court cases, such as the AFP vs Morel case in 2o12<a href="#ref9" class="reference-link">[9]</a>. In January 2010, photographer Daniel Morel posted a series of photographs on Twitter showing the devastation caused by the earthquake in Haiti. Without his permission, AFP then obtained and distributed several of these photographs to its subscribers, including Getty Images, which in turn made them available for licensing by third parties<a href="#ref13" class="reference-link">[13]</a>. Morel filed a lawsuit against AFP and Getty Images, claiming they had infringed his copyright by using his photographs without permission. AFP and Getty Images argued that they were not liable for copyright infringement because they believed the photographs were in the public domain and freely available for use<a href="#ref14" class="reference-link">[14]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In a landmark ruling, a US District Court judge awarded Morel $1.2 million in damages, citing the wilful violation of his copyright by AFP and Getty Images. This landmark case had several implications for journalism practice and policy, particularly concerning copyright law and the use of social media content<a href="#ref14" class="reference-link">[14]</a>. One implication is the need to understand the limitations of the fair use theory. Prior to the last decades, many news agencies believed that content posted on social media was free to use without permission, with various US newsrooms like CNN referencing the fair use doctrine<a href="#ref10" class="reference-link">[10]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Fair use theory, as part of the US copyright acts 1976, has been a legal principle that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without the owner's permission under certain circumstances, such as for news reporting, criticism, and commentary. Similar to the AFP vs Morel case, the Otto v. Hearst Communications Inc. case involved a picture of a photographer posted by another user on Instagram and later used by Hearst Communications. The court rejected the defendant's fair use defence and ruled in favour of Jonathan Otto<a href="#ref15" class="reference-link">[15]</a><a href="#ref16" class="reference-link">[16]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Another implication was a debate that has led to an increase in consciousness of journalists to obtain permission from content creators before using their work, even if the content is publicly available on social media platforms<a href="#ref9" class="reference-link">[9]</a>. In response to copyright cases, news agencies have implemented new policies and procedures for using content from social media platforms, including seeking permission from the original content creator and verifying the authenticity of the content<a href="#ref17" class="reference-link">[17]</a>. News agencies like the BBC have also started providing more comprehensive training for journalists and other staff on copyright law and social media best practices<a href="#ref18" class="reference-link">[18]</a>. Although UGC issues such as copyright laws were highlighted in the example of the AFP vs Morel case, other issues around practice and policy have also been raised<a href="#ref4" class="reference-link">[4]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Several policy issues related to content verification and privacy rights have been raised due to the rise of user-generated content<a href="#ref19" class="reference-link">[19]</a><a href="#ref20" class="reference-link">[20]</a>. Policy issues in this context refer to the rules and guidelines established by media organisations and governments to govern the conduct of journalists and social media users when it comes to UGC<a href="#ref12" class="reference-link">[12]</a>. Johnson and Dade (2019), in their study of boundary work, UGC and journalism, observed the inherent issue of local broadcast journalists including unverified UGC in their stories for the purposes of increasing audience engagement. This is in addition to innovations around audience metrics and click baits, which have increased the use of unverified UGC content in the news<a href="#ref17" class="reference-link">[17]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                For example, during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, social media was swamped with fraudulent and deceptive photographs, videos, and eyewitness stories which were then published by multiple news outlets<a href="#ref9" class="reference-link">[9]</a>. These acts led to widespread misinformation. For instance, despite being proven incorrect, a photo of a young man falsely identified as one of the bombing suspects went popular on social media and was later picked up by various news organisations<a href="#ref17" class="reference-link">[17]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                In another scenario, a survivor of the bombing filed a lawsuit against CNN, NBC, and other media organisations for using a photo of him taken in the aftermath of the bombing without his permission. The photo was initially posted on Twitter and subsequently picked up by these media outlets. The lawsuit alleged that the media organisations had violated the survivor's right of publicity and had acted recklessly and negligently by failing to obtain his consent or verify his identity. Although a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the media organisations were protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press, the case underscores the complex legal and ethical issues surrounding the use of user-generated content in journalism<a href="#ref21" class="reference-link">[21]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                As a result of this and the implications of similar scenarios, civil societies like the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) amended their code of ethics in 2014, replacing the 1996 version to strongly reflect the current challenges. One of the new codes states that journalists should show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage and should balance the public's need for information against potential harm or discomfort<a href="#ref22" class="reference-link">[22]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                While the implications of the usage of user-generated content in the case of the Boston bombing coverage included privacy rights, copyright and trauma-related reporting, one question that has raised several debates is the implication of eyewitness reporting and adoption of these contents in situations where there is a lack of access for journalists to get a first-hand view of the event. For example, in the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, a graduate student Jamal Albarghouti recorded a live video of the violence, which he uploaded to CNN's iReport website and became widely praised, a fit that several media organisations have since emulated. Since then iReport has grown into a massive team called CNN's global unit for social discovery, which focuses on finding and verifying imagery and reports around stories of the day. The BBC, Aljazeera and many other global media organisations now have a dedicated service for user-generated content, even more in fragile democracies like sub-Saharan Africa, where local radio stations like Nigrinfo fm (Nigeria) now have online platforms and radio shows dedicated to eyewitness reports<a href="#ref8" class="reference-link">[8]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                An implication of these is a threat to the gate-keeping role of journalists. The gatekeeping theory suggests that journalists act as gatekeepers who control the flow of information by deciding what news to cover, how to present it, and to whom to present it<a href="#ref23" class="reference-link">[23]</a>. With the rise of UGC in the media, it can be argued that this democratises the gate-keeping role of journalists, which could lead to severe consequences like disinformation and misinformation even though sometimes, user-generated contents are included in news delivery only once verified<a href="#ref24" class="reference-link">[24]</a>. Although this can also seem advantageous, verification of user-generated content has contributed to challenges such as misinformation that has directly or indirectly impacted democracies, encouraged a lack of trust in the media and encouraged governments to raise policies that have affected the practice of media organisations<a href="#ref25" class="reference-link">[25]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Governments in various countries, particularly in fragile democracies, have sometimes enacted new laws which have raised practice issues for journalists<a href="#ref20" class="reference-link">[20]</a>. Practice issues in this context refer to journalists' day-to-day decisions and actions while performing their duties. These duties include verification, fact-checking, and ethical decision-making. Practice issues also include considerations of bias, objectivity, and the quality of reporting.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                While UGC has democratised storytelling, social media has also empowered untrained eyewitnesses and citizen journalists to share stories freely, challenging the agenda-setting theory and leading to questions about the practice of journalism<a href="#ref26" class="reference-link">[26]</a>. The agenda-setting theory suggests that the media can influence public perceptions and attitudes by deciding what stories to report and how to present them<a href="#ref27" class="reference-link">[27]</a>. Social media platforms can prioritize specific UGC over others and frame it in a particular way, thereby shaping the public understanding of the issue being covered. Furthermore, UGC can also be used to set the media agenda, as stories or events that gain significant attention on social media can prompt news organizations to cover them and give them greater prominence<a href="#ref28" class="reference-link">[28]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                This has subsequently been blamed for several protests and national uprisings in various countries, including the Arab Spring, the black lives matter movement, and the ENDSARS protest in Nigeria<a href="#ref29" class="reference-link">[29]</a><a href="#ref30" class="reference-link">[30]</a><a href="#ref31" class="reference-link">[31]</a>. For instance, In August 2019, the Nigerian government took a firm stance on the use of UGC in media organisations within the country. The government sued 15 media organisations and threatened to sanction the BBC for what it described as "irresponsible use of social media in Nigeria"<a href="#ref30" class="reference-link">[30]</a>. This was in response to the BBC's coverage of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria protests, which included the use of UGC. The Nigerian government argued that the BBC had violated its broadcasting code by failing to verify the authenticity of the content before transmitting it<a href="#ref32" class="reference-link">[32]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                BBC has challenged the sanction, arguing that the content was in the public interest. In November 2019, the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) issued a new code of conduct for broadcast media organisations. The code included provisions that require broadcasters to verify the authenticity of UGC and avoid transmitting content that may incite violence or promote hate speech<a href="#ref31" class="reference-link">[31]</a>. NBC also introduced new licensing regulations for web-based broadcasters, which include registering, complying with a range of regulations and paying licensing fees<a href="#ref33" class="reference-link">[33]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the Nigerian communications commission issued regulations that require internet service providers to block access to any content that is deemed offensive or harmful. This has been criticised by some as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression and limit the ability of journalists to use UGC in their reporting<a href="#ref24" class="reference-link">[24]</a>. Between 2018 and 2022, there have been over 21 fines and legal issues against media organisations, with a huge percentage based on UGC, impacting the nation's media freedom index and leading to cross-national self-censorship that has affected objectivity and quality of reporting<a href="#ref30" class="reference-link">[30]</a><a href="#ref34" class="reference-link">[34]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                While some scholars argued in favour of social media platforms, freedom of expression and democratisation of the public discourse on national issues, some others believe problems like misinformation and disinformation have increased the challenges faced by developing democracies, like in the case of the ENDSARS protest in Nigeria which the government blamed on social media placing a seven months ban on Twitter<a href="#ref35" class="reference-link">[35]</a><a href="#ref36" class="reference-link">[36]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Another implication for journalism in the Nigeria case is the question of liability for the content. In many cases, UGC may contain false or defamatory information that can harm individuals or organisations. Media organisations that transmit UGC may be liable for any such harm, even if they did not create the content themselves, such as in the case of Nigeria's Channels TV, which was fined N5 million for airing a BBC documentary. The liability of online intermediaries in some countries is guided by the "notice and takedown" procedure<a href="#ref12" class="reference-link">[12]</a>. This approach requires online intermediaries to remove content marked as illegal or infringing after receiving notification from a third party.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                This approach, which has been enshrined in numerous laws and regulations such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States and the EU E-Commerce Directive in Europe, is meant to balance the need to safeguard free expression with the need to remove harmful or illegal content<a href="#ref37" class="reference-link">[37]</a>. However, the notice-and-takedown system has been criticised for potentially infringing on media freedom, mainly when intermediaries are motivated to remove information before receiving notification. This can result in the removal of excessive amounts of content, including content that is valid or protected by free expression legislation<a href="#ref38" class="reference-link">[38]</a>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Overall, the Nigerian government's actions in these examples highlight the practical, legal, and policy implications of the rise of user-generated content (UGC) within the country, which is projected to involve 48.11% of the total population by 2027<a href="#ref39" class="reference-link">[39]</a>.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                            <p>
                                In conclusion, the rise of user-generated content (UGC) has significantly impacted the journalism industry, raising several practice, policy, and legal issues. These issues include copyright infringement, privacy rights, and content censorship, raising several implications including challenging the traditional role of journalists as gatekeepers of the news. However, despite these challenges, UGC has also created new opportunities, such as citizen journalism.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Legal cases such as AFP vs. Morel, Doe vs CNN, NBC, and Nigeria vs BBC cases have raised issues around copyrights, privacy, defamation, verification and content liability which have all had significant implications in practice for journalism. To address these issues, news agencies have implemented new policies and procedures for using content from social media platforms, including seeking permission from the original content creator and verifying the authenticity of the content. Also, journalists are provided comprehensive training on copyright law and social media best practices.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As the use of user-generated content in journalism evolves, news organisations must negotiate the obstacles and opportunities it brings and set clear policies regarding the use of UGC within the professional news space to ensure accurate, ethical, and responsible coverage of important events.
                            </p>
